# Trying latex-action
Cheng XU has developed a super nice github action to build tex files called [latex-action](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-action).
For more examples, one can have a look into [tutorials](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-tutorial) or even his [cv](https://github.com/xu-cheng/cv).
That said, this repository is to test such action and showing what the not obvious instructions in order to use it.
